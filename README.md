# tokenX

**Participation, culture, and coordination — rooted in the Caribbean.**

tokenX is a public crypto token and network designed to enable open participation, cultural expression, and economic coordination in a permissionless way.

This repository contains the core documents that define what tokenX is, what it is not, and how it is intended to function.

---

## What is tokenX?

tokenX is a **public participation token**.

It is:
- open to retail and institutional participants
- culturally expressive and regionally grounded
- economically emergent
- governed by voluntary use and free markets

tokenX does **not** promise returns, stability, or ownership of assets.  
Value, if any, is discovered through use.

## Core Documents

### 📜 Charter
**[`charter.md`](./charter.md)**

The Charter defines:
- why tokenX exists
- what tokenX stands for
- what tokenX explicitly does *not* promise
- how participation, markets, and culture are treated

The Charter is intentionally non-technical.  
It is a cultural and philosophical anchor.

---

### 📊 Tokenomics
**[`tokenomics.md`](./tokenomics.md)**

The Tokenomics document defines:
- total supply (fixed at 10B tokenX)
- allocation and vesting
- how tokenX is used in practice
- how value flows through the network
- the role of the tokenX Foundation

Tokenomics focuses on **mechanics**, not price predictions.

---

## Design Principles

tokenX is built on a few simple ideas:

- **Participation over permission**  
  Anyone can take part. No approval required.

- **Use before narrative**  
  Activity matters more than storytelling.

- **Culture is infrastructure**  
  Art, music, events, and identity are first-class.

- **Free markets**  
  Volatility and speculation are expected, not moralized.

- **No false promises**  
  tokenX does not guarantee outcomes.

---

## Technology

- Initial deployment: **Sui blockchain**
- Design goal: **chain-agnostic**
- Future paths may include:
  - multi-chain deployments
  - mirrors or bridges
  - ecosystem-led experimentation

No chain is assumed to be permanent.

---

## The tokenX Foundation

The tokenX network is stewarded by the **tokenX Foundation**, which exists to:
- support ecosystem development
- fund public goods and grants
- maintain protocol infrastructure
- represent the network externally when needed

The Foundation does **not**:
- control token price
- promise returns
- manage markets

Stewardship is not ownership.

---

## Risk Disclosure

Participation in tokenX involves risk, including:
- market volatility
- technical risk
- regulatory uncertainty
- social and cultural dynamics

Participation is voluntary.  
No guarantees are made.

---

## Getting Involved

tokenX is open by design.

Ways to participate include:
- holding or using tokenX
- building projects or tools
- creating events or cultural initiatives
- contributing ideas or code
- experimenting responsibly

There is no single “right” way to participate.

---

## Closing

tokenX does not ask for trust.

It asks for:
- curiosity
- participation
- responsibility

The rest is discovered together.

---

*tokenX does not promise returns. Participation is at your own risk.*
