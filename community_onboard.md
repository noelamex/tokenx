# Welcome to the tokenX Community

This page is for people who are curious about tokenX and want to participate responsibly.

tokenX is an open experiment.  
There are no prerequisites, no secret access, and no required beliefs.

What matters is **how** you participate.

---

## What This Community Is

The tokenX community exists to:

- explore new ways of coordinating participation
- support builders, creators, and organizers
- experiment openly, without guarantees
- treat culture as infrastructure
- allow the free market to exist without letting it dominate everything

This is not a fan club.  
It is not a pump group.  
It is not a DAO (yet, maybe never).

It is a place to **do things**.

---

## What Participation Means

Participation does **not** mean buying a token.

Participation can mean:

- reading and understanding the charter
- asking thoughtful questions
- building something small
- hosting a meetup or discussion
- creating art, writing, or remixing ideas
- critiquing tokenX honestly and publicly
- experimenting responsibly

Holding tokenX does not grant status.
Contribution does.

## How to Get Started (Choose One)

You don’t need to do everything. Pick one path.

### 🛠 Builders
- Read the tokenomics and contract README
- Prototype something small
- Share what you learn (even if it fails)
- Ask questions in public when possible

### 🎨 Creators & Cultural Organizers
- Interpret tokenX creatively
- Host events, discussions, or performances
- Use tokenX as a coordination tool, not a brand
- Share outcomes, not just announcements

### 🧭 Curious Participants
- Read the “Why tokenX exists” page
- Join discussions
- Observe how things evolve
- Ask questions without assuming answers

All paths are valid.

## Community Norms (Read Carefully)

These are not rules — they are expectations.

### 1. No Promises
Do not promise:
- price appreciation
- returns
- guaranteed outcomes

tokenX explicitly rejects these narratives.

---

### 2. No Entitlement
Owning tokenX does not entitle anyone to:
- attention
- influence
- special access
- decision-making power

Respect is earned through contribution.

---

### 3. Build > Shill
If you want to promote something:
- show what you built
- share what happened
- talk about what worked or didn’t

Empty promotion will be ignored.

---

### 4. Critique Is Welcome
Thoughtful critique is encouraged.

Bad faith attacks, harassment, or price-only commentary are not productive and will not be amplified.

---

### 5. Culture Matters
tokenX is rooted in Caribbean identity, but it is open globally.

Respect:
- people
- context
- history
- differences

Cultural expression is welcome. Cultural extraction is not.

---

## What the Foundation Does (and Doesn’t Do)

The tokenX Foundation exists to:

- support ecosystem development
- fund public goods and grants
- maintain infrastructure
- help coordinate when needed

The Foundation does **not**:
- control token price
- promise outcomes
- override voluntary activity
- manage the community like a company

If something happens organically, that’s a feature — not a failure.

---

## Where to Ask Questions

- Start with the FAQ
- Read the Charter and Tokenomics
- Ask publicly when possible — it helps others learn
- Private messages should be used sparingly

There is no “support desk.”  
This is an open network.

---

## A Note on Risk

tokenX involves real risk.

Participation is voluntary.  
No guarantees are made.

If you are uncomfortable with uncertainty, this may not be the right space for you — and that’s okay.

---

## In Closing

tokenX does not ask for belief.

It asks for:
- curiosity
- responsibility
- participation

What this becomes depends on who shows up — and what they choose to do.

Welcome.

*tokenX does not promise returns. Participation is at your own risk.*
