## Token Utility (v0)

tokenX is designed for **participation**, not promises.

Primary uses include:

- **Staking**
  - Signal commitment to the network
  - Register projects, events, and initiatives
- **Access**
  - Token-gated communities, tools, and experiences
- **Ecosystem Fees**
  - Certain protocol actions require tokenX
  - Fees may be burned or routed to ecosystem funds
- **Culture**
  - NFTs, events, creative programs, and regional expression

There is no guaranteed yield, dividend, or profit share.

## Flow of Participation & Value

tokenX does not distribute revenue directly to holders.

Instead, value emerges indirectly through network activity and usage.

![tokenX flow of participation](./assets/tokenx_flow_diagram.svg)

**Conceptually:**

- Users, builders, and projects stake or spend tokenX to participate
- Protocol actions generate fees in tokenX
- Fees are:
  - partially burned, and/or
  - routed to ecosystem or foundation funds
- Token holders benefit indirectly from increased utility and demand
