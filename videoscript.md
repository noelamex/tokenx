# Short Manifesto Video Script

*(60–90 seconds, voiceover-friendly, cinematic but grounded)*

This is designed for:

* a simple launch video
* a homepage hero video
* narrated slides
* motion graphics

Tone: **calm, confident, human** — not crypto hype.

### **tokenX — Participation, Not Permission**

*(Video Script)*

> The Caribbean is not short on creativity.
>
> It is not short on culture.
>
> It is not short on talent.

*(visuals: ocean, islands, people, music, markets, code, diaspora cities)*

> What it has always struggled with…
>
> is coordination.

*(cut to fragmented maps, disconnected flows)*

> Value flows through the region every day.
>
> Tourism. Agriculture. Art. Labor. Ideas.
>
> And most of it passes through… without staying.

*(pause)*

> tokenX is an experiment.
>
> Not a promise.
>
> Not a shortcut to wealth.

*(simple graphics: tokenX symbol, network forming)*

> tokenX is a shared way to participate.
>
> A way to coordinate — openly, globally, without permission.

*(visuals: builders, events, code, wallets, communities)*

> It doesn’t replace local currencies.
>
> It doesn’t guarantee returns.
>
> It doesn’t ask for trust.

*(beat)*

> It asks for participation.

*(music builds subtly)*

> Culture is not decoration.
>
> It’s infrastructure.
>
> And networks grow where people feel ownership.

*(visuals: art, festivals, meetups, code commits)*

> tokenX is open.
>
> Messy.
>
> Voluntary.

*(calm closing)*

> What it becomes…
>
> depends on who shows up.

*(final frame)*

> **tokenX**
> Participation, not permission.

*(small text)*

> tokenX does not promise returns. Participation involves risk.

## How These Two Pieces Work Together

* **Explainer** → education, clarity, trust
* **Video** → emotion, identity, memory

Together they:

* attract the right people
* repel the wrong expectations
* set tone early
* age well
